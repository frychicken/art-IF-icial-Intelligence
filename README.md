# art(IF)icial Intelligence

## What is this? 

> This is avoiding objects (Obstacles) simulator written in java

Hey, this is how auto-car works (just kidding, if this is how, maybe there are many car crashes [but you get the point])

## known issues

>Sometimes, it does not go as expected

~~for ob > 1 obstacles: sometimes the object just does not go as expected due to the algorithm~~

~~for ob = 3 obstacles: sometimes the object just does not go as expected due to the algorithm~~
